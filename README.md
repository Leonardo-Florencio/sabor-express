Python project that allows to create, to list and to modify different restaurants as a back-end application.

This application will show a complete Main Menu with four different options: register a restaurant, list all restaurants, change the restaurant's status and close the application.

All of this will be done by keyboard commands, using numbers, strings and the "enter" option.

Also, the application has simple verification methods to be sure that all inputed data matches the dictionarie's "key:value"/menu selection format.
